Inventory_cycle_count_P1 

This project involves analyzing inventory cycle count data for an e-commerce company. The goal is to provide insights into inventory accuracy, establish optimal cycle count frequencies, identify discrepancies and recommend actionable improvements. The dataset contains columns for week, product name, inventory count, product ID, quantity and location.

Project Outline:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
1.1 Handling missing values and duplicates (identify missing or null values in each column. Find duplicate records and remove them);
1.2 Feature engineering (create new features from existing data).

2. Data Analysis
2.1 Descriptive analysis (compute summary statistics for numerical columns, such as mean, median, and standard deviation);
2.2 Inventory trends (investigate how inventory counts change over time and across different weeks);
2.3 Cycle count frequencies (determine the frequency of cycle counts for various products. Assess if there is a link between cycle count frequency and inventory accuracy);
2.4 Discrepancies and errors (examine discrepancies between inventory counts and actual quantities. Pinpoint products or locations with higher error rates);
2.5 Location-based analysis (evaluate inventory accuracy based on location. Explore correlations between location and cycle count frequency).

3. Data Visualization
3.1 Visualizing key metrics and trends (create bar plot and pie chart to represent the distribution of products and cycle count frequencies).

E-commerce_P2 

This project aims to analyze e-commerce data to gain insights into product and category trends, identify factors influencing web purchases, evaluate success of marketing campaigns and determine underperforming channels.

Project Outline:

1. Data Cleaning
1.1 Handling missing values (check for missing values in each column);
1.2 Removing duplicates (identify and remove duplicates to ensure data integrity).

2. Data Analysis
2.1 Most frequent categories (identify most frequently sold categories);
2.2 Marketing campaign analysis (analyze success of different marketing campaigns by comparing with sales data);
2.3 Channel performance (assess performance of different channels by comparing engagement metrics. Identify underperforming channels);

3. Data Visualization
3.1 Frequent categories (bar chart to show most frequent categories).

Consumer_complaints_P3

This project focuses on analyzing consumer complaints data to investigate common issues and products, identify submission trends and assess response effectiveness.

Project Outline:

1. Data Cleaning & Transformation
1.1 Handle missing values (identify and handle missing or null values);
1.2 Create new column (calculate response time by creating a new column).

2. Data Analysis
2.1 Frequency analysis (identify most common products, issues, and submission methods);
2.2 Timely responses (find distribution of timely responses across different products).

3. Data Visualization
3.1 Frequent products (bar chart to show top products with most complaints);
3.2 Frequent issues (bar chart to show top reported issues).
